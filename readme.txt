== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a new event? =
In the main dashboard, clcick on 'event' then 'add new'.

= What's the shortcode? =
[qem]

= How can I change the date format? = 
Use the plugin settings page. You have the option of US format (MM/DD/YYYY) or the one the rest of the world uses (DD/MM/YYYY). You can also change the size and colour of the icon.

= How do I change the colours and things? =
Use the plugin settings page. You can't style individual events, they all look the same.

= Can I add more fields? =
No.

= Why not? =
Well OK yes you can add more fields if you want but you are going to have to fiddle about with the php file which needs a bit of care and attention. Everything you need to know is in the [wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin).
